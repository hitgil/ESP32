# ESP32
ESP32 for fun.
The ESP32S2-CAM captures images using an ESP32-S2 and OV2640 camera, uploading them to AWS S3. It's programmed with Arduino IDE. The File Upload Server, built with Node.js and Express.js, lets users upload images, saving them in a designated folder. Both modules utilize the AWS SDK for image uploads.
